# UnityModules

Useful small modular Unity3D scripts for general purpose game development.

Pull requests welcome if it does not break interfaces.

## Bezier
Simple Bezier Curve functions.
Currently only supports Quadratic functions.

## HSV
HSV Module to support color space calculations in HSV rather than RGBA.


## ReadOnlyAttributes
Flag properties with ReadOnly to still show them in UnityEditor but make them uneditable.
